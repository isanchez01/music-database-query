# music-database-query
A program that allows users to commit various queries on a spreadsheet containing the discographies of musical artists. Such queries include viewing the entire spreadsheet, and looking up the discography of a certain artist. 

Current Possible Queries: 
To view the entire spreadsheet, users should type in VIEW SHEET
To query an artist's discography, users should first type in LOOKUP ARTIST and then type in the name of the artist they want to lookup

Queries are not case-sensitive, however the artist in the LOOKUP ARTIST Query should have each first letter capitalized (Like This).
