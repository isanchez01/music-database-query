# music-database-query
A program that allows users to commit various queries on a spreadsheet containing the discographies of musical artists. Such queries include viewing the entire spreadsheet, and looking up the discography of a certain artist. 

Current Possible Queries: <br> <br>
To view the entire spreadsheet, users should type in VIEW SHEET <br>
To query an artist's discography, users should first type in LOOKUP ARTIST and then type in the name of the artist they want to lookup

Queries are not case-sensitive, however the artist in the LOOKUP ARTIST query should have each first letter capitalized (Like This).
  So for example, if you wanted to lookup the discography of Eric Clapton, you would type his name in like that
  
I would like to remind users that this is my first project, so don't laugh. In all seriousness, if you have any ideas on how I could improve my code, do not hesitate to shoot me an email. I am always open to constructive criticism, after all, this IS my first project so I'm fairly certain that there are a multitude of optimizations that could be made. However, DO NOT UNOBJECTIVELY RANT ABOUT MY CODE! Don't be that guy that sends me a derogatory email cursing me out about how I should never go near a computer again just because I didn't type a for loop in the "correct syntax". Instead, if you see that I could improve a loop's syntax, polielty email me about it.

An addendum I would like to add would be that this is an ongoing project. As I refine my programming skills, more features will be added. I currently have plans to add a graphical interface, expand the spreadsheet, optimize searching speed, and of course, adding more queries. 

As a reminder, don't forget to add the jar files in the folder titled <em>jar_files_you_probably_need</em> to your classpath <br> <br>
  To do this:
  <ul>
    <li> Right-click on your project folder in Eclipse</li>
    <li> Click on Build Path </li>
    <li> Click on Configure Bulid Path </li>
    <li> Click on the Libraries tab </li>
    <li> Find and click on classpath </li>
    <li> Click on Add External JARs </li>
    <li> Finally, find the folder you downloaded contain </li>
  </ul>
   
Thank you for going through this project
